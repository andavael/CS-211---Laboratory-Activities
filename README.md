#### 🌟 *Overview*  
This activity introduces fundamental programming concepts in Java through hands-on exercises. It focuses on user input handling, formatting outputs, and understanding key Java concepts such as type casting and escape sequences. The tasks involve comparing characters and collecting song details from users while ensuring efficient memory usage. This activity covers **Introduction to Java**, which serves as the foundation for the exercises and concepts explored.

#### *📂 Files Included*  

| **File**               | **Description**                                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GettingGreater.java** | A program that compares two characters input by the user and displays the one with the greater ASCII value, along with their corresponding ASCII codes.  |
| **GettingInputs.java**  | A program that prompts the user to input details about a song (year, genre, album, title, artist) and displays the formatted song information. |

#### *🎯 Objectives*  

1. **Efficiently Use the `Scanner` Class**  
   > Master the art of taking user inputs with the `Scanner` class, and ensure proper resource management by closing the scanner to avoid memory leaks and keep your code efficient.

2. **Use Escape Sequences Efficiently**  
   > Learn to wield escape sequences like `\n` and `\"` for neat and professional string formatting, giving your outputs a clear and organized structure.

3. **Properly Implement Type Casting**  
   > Dive into type casting to smoothly convert between data types in Java, ensuring that your program handles inputs and outputs accurately, without losing data or causing errors.
